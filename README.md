# Dispensary

Hi guys, it's a dispensary website was designed by Avada and I've just made some tasteful changes to enhance its appeal; I want to make it clear that I am not a drug dealer; it's just a practice but if you need some blue stuff CM 😅

I hope you found it impressive.

Sincerely 🙋🏼‍♂️
## Info
It's a dispensary website for purchasing cannabis products, such as cannabis concentrates, flowers, and edibles. The attractive animation draws visitors including me. and because that developed without jS, so I was code it.
